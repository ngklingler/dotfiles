## todo
[ ] find better way to install utils (either just check if they exist or delegate to lpm)
[ ] make resilient to missing dependencies (don't use tmux in bashrc if tmux missing, etc)
[ ] include alacritty config
[ ] include i3 config
[ ] create update script
[x] improve bash completion (C-n and C-p work w/ vi mode, `bind TAB:menu-complete` is also an option)
